## Introduction

In this small application, some libraries are tested to try to imitate interactive applications (such as the angular CLI) and others that allow them to be more eye-catching for the user and much more friendly.

Although the application is the classic "TO DO app", the main intention is to familiarize the libraries, asynchronous programming (based on async/await promises) and lay some foundations for what will be an application in the future that will create projects in node.js automatically and with little interaction.

## Installation.

It is only necessary to install the list of dependencies, for this it is enough to run in terminal:

```
npm install
```
